## Transition Release Workflow

The transition release workflow consists of the following steps:

1. alerting the maintainers of the impending release
2. restricting access for maintainers
3. creating the release
4. committing artifacts and tagging the release

### Pre-transition

Before you enter this workflow, for Carpentries Lessons, it's important to do
the following steps:

1. update the repository with [carpentries/styles] using the [update styles
   script](https://github.com/carpentries/actions/blob/main/update-styles/update-styles.sh)
   and create a pull request
   ```sh
   REPO=[repo]
   git clone ${REPO} ${REPO} && cd ${REPO}
   git switch -c update-styles-2023-04
   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries/actions/main/update-styles/update-styles.sh | bash /dev/stdin
   git commit -m 'update styles 2023-04'
   git push --set-upstream origin update-styles-2023-04
   ```
2. After styles is merged, Create a lesson release using the [{chisel}
   package](https://github.com/carpentries/chisel) (NOTE: this is only for Core
   Team use). Create a Pull Request
3. Use the [{gitcellar} package](https://docs.ropensci.org/gitcellar/) to
   create an archive of the repository and store it in an archive like AWS Glacier
   (note: this will take some time)
   ```r
   library("gitcellar")
   library("future")
   plan(multisession)
   get_repo <- function(slug) {
     repo <- strsplit(slug, "/")[[1]]
     future({
       download_organization_repos(repo[[1]], keep = repo[[2]])
     })
   }
   today <- lapply(c("carpentries/instructor-training", "swcarpentry/python-novice-inflammation"),
     get_repo)
   ```
4. as an extra precaution, clone a bare mirror of the repository using `git clone --mirror ${REPO}`

Once these steps are done, we can then proceed with the transition.


### Requirements

To get this running, you need the requirements for this repo:

 - git
 - python version >= 3
 - R version >= 4.1

#### GitHub PAT

The release workflow REQUIRES a GitHub personal access token to be avaialble via
the environment variable `RELEASE_PAT`. This token can have one of two forms

##### Fine-Grained PAT (preferred)

As of 2023-04-07, I have updated the workflow to work with fine-grained
Personal Access Tokens. The benefit of these is that we can restrict the
tokens to specific repositories so that when we are doing the transition, we do
not run into a situation where repositories we already transitioned (or have
yet to transition) are not accidentally clobbered.

To create a new token, head over to <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new> and then set the resources this way:

| parameter | value | notes |
| --------- | ----- | ----- |
| Resource owner | The GitHub organisation | if you use your personal account, you may not have access |
| Repository access | Only select repositories | leave this blank until we are ready to work with it |
| Repository permissions | Read and Write on **actions, administration, contents, pages, pull requests, workflows** |  |
| Organization permissions | none |  |


The good thing about these tokens is that their permissions can be modified on
the fly and they can be regenerated with one click. This means that it will be
possible to create one token, store it in your environment, and then update it
as you work through the release process.

##### Token (classic)

I have created [a tutorial if you do not have one](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/github-pat.html#creating-a-new-github-personal-access-token).

Your token should have the following scopes: `repo,user,workflow`.

You must also have _admin access_ to whatever organisation you wish to deploy to
.

### Alerting the maintainers and restricting access

The `create-collab-notice.R` script takes a repository name as its argument and
gives you markdown text for you to paste into a comment: 

```bash
$ Rscript create-collab-notice.R carpentries/maintainer-onboarding
â„¹ Gathering collaborators for carpentries/maintainer-onboarding with at least push access

â”€â”€ displaying to screen â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
This lesson will be converted to use [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench]
To prevent accidental reversion of the changes, we are temporarily revoking
write access for all collaborators on this lesson:

 - [ ] @chendaniely (push)
 - [ ] @katrinleinweber (push)
 - [ ] @vinisalazar (push)

If you no longer wish to have write access to this repository, you do not
need to do anything further.

access ([example comment to admin](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/bioc-project/issues/48#issuecomment-1435372672)).


### Adding Tokens to your environment

One important thing: if you do not want your tokens exposed in your bash
history, then add a blank space before your commands. This makes fixing mistakes
annoying, but means that you don't have a bunch of tokens floating in your 
history to exploit. 

#### If you have installed [vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-install)

I like to use vault to store my tokens because it's an extra layer that allows
me to store them without having to export them as variables. I'm pretty sure 
there is a better way, but I don't know about it.

I've modified [instructions from their tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/getting-started-secrets-engines?in=vault/getting-started)

Start by opening two new bash shells.

In one shell, start by running `vault server -dev`. This will display something
like 

```
WARNING! dev mode is enabled! In this mode, Vault runs entirely in-memory
and starts unsealed with a single unseal key. The root token is already
authenticated to the CLI, so you can immediately begin using Vault.

You may need to set the following environment variables:

    $ export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
```

Leave that shell open because that is what's running your vault server. Copy
and paste the export statement into your original window and the second window.

Now it is time to place your secrets into the key-value (kv) store. Each store
is labelled by a path, which can store multiple key-value pairs:

```bash
# note the space at the beginning
 vault secrets enable -version=2 -path=tr kv 
```

Now it's time to place your token(s)  in the store. I like to create the tokens
on their own lines, so note the slash at the end. 

```bash
# note the space at the beginning
 vault kv put -mount=tr auth \
release=<PASTE TOKEN HERE> \
pat=<PASTE_TOKEN_HERE>
```

From there, I can use [`./pat.sh release`](pat.sh) to extract the release token
to pass into a new variable.

##### Updating the token

As you go through the release process, you will want to update the token based
on the lesson program you are using. To do that you can use the `patch` method:

```bash
# note the space at the beginning
 vault kv patch -mount=tr auth \
release=<PASTE TOKEN HERE>
```


#### If you do not have vault installed

If you do not have vault installed, you can still store your tokens as local
variables,

```bash
# note the space at the beginning
 RELEASE_PAT=<PASTE_TOKEN_HERE>
 GITHUB_PAT=<PASTE_TOKEN_HERE>
```

### Creating the Release

To create the release, you will use the following command (note the spaces at
the beginning of the command to hide it from the shell history).

```bash
# if you are using vault
 RELEASE_PAT=$(./pat.sh release) make release/[org]/[repo].json
# otherwise
 RELEASE_PAT=github_XXX make release/[org]/[repo].json
```

where `[org]` is the organisattion and `[repo]` is the lesson name. For example,
this created the release for the bioc intro lesson for carpentries incubator:

```
 RELEASE_PAT=$(./pat.sh release) make release/carpentries-incubator/bioc-intro.json
```

The release process will take a few minutes depending on the speed of your
processor and the speed of your connection. When it is finished, you will have
[a set of files with a `*.hash`
extension](https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-transition/commit/747030b61359a61bd01e299ab2d7ff5714af69d9).
These are the outputs from the commit process.

#### Recovering from failure

Because this involves networking, there are different modes of failure that can
lead to a borked transfer. I will be adding situations as they come up

##### Invalid token

if you see an error that looks something like this, then it's likely that your
PAT (hopefully a fine-grained PAT) does not have the right permissions.

```r

### On GitHub

When it is finished, you must comment on the original issue. Here is a template:

```markdown
The deed is done. The infrastructure takes a few minutes to bootstrap and cache the packages for the lesson build. Once the build is done, I will switch github pages to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch and you will have your workbench lesson. 

Thank you all for your enthusiasm and your patience!
```

From there, you actually do need to wait for the build to complete before setting
github pages to deploy from `gh-pages`

### Add invalid hash

The transition process will remove and/or overwrite commits. This allows us to
detect if someone is attempting to create a pull request from an old fork.

For each lesson, a file called `release/{org}/{lesson}-invalid.hash` is created.
This contains a single hash representing a has that was present in the
repository just before the transition that was no longer present. These hashes
are stored in JSON format in <https://files.carpentries.org/invalid-hashes.json>.

To add to this, update the file in <https://github.com/carpentries/reactables>. 

#### lessons built with carpentries/styles

Lessons that were originally built with carpentries/styles will all have a
common ancestor commit that can be safely ignored: 
[e83e2c9bd](https://github.com/carpentries/styles/commit/e83e2c9bdeb259fcb7b12ae21da8f6eac8ff34a4)

However, the commit that appears in `release/{org}/{lesson}-invalid.hash` may not
be that one. 

#### lesson built with remote theme

For lessons that were built with the remote theme, such as
<https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/managing-computational-projects>, they
will all have different invalid hashes and there will be fewer empty hashes (in
the case of this lesson, there is only [one empty
hash](https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-transition/blob/e5fc4ff9e810e6bda9ebc2730d55f9639fc9177d/release/carpentries-incubator/managing-computational-projects-commit-map.hash#L255).
One thing to watch out for, however, are lessons that started with remote theme
and accidentally merged with styles at some point in time. If
`release/{org}/{lesson}-invalid.hash` contains
[e83e2c9bd](https://github.com/carpentries/styles/commit/e83e2c9bdeb259fcb7b12ae21da8f6eac8ff34a4),
then there is a chance that this commit may not capture all the potential
forks. To solve this issue, find the first commit of the repository and
reference the commit map to find the invalid commit.

### Commit and create tag

You should commit these release hash files:

```sh
git add release/
git commit -m 'release [org]/[lesson]'
```

Once you do that, you can tag it. If you use gpg on your machine, I would highly
recommend that you _sign_ your tag:

```sh
git tag -s release_[abbrev]/[lesson] -m '[your message here]'
```

Here are the naming conventions for `[abbrev]`:

| tag | organisation     |
| --- | ---------------- |
| cp  | carpentries      |
| dc  | datacarpentry    |
| swc | swcarpentry      |
| lc  | librarycarpentry |
| lab | carpentries-lab  |
| incubator | carpentries-incubator |


Once you do that, then you can push the commit and tag up with:

```sh
git push
git push --tags
```

If you have a set of releases that you want to do, I would recommend to not push
until you are finished. This way, when the submodules update on the remote, you 
don't have to worry about conflicts due to the changed histories of the lessons
that you just converted.

### After pushing commits and tags

After the commits and tags are pushed, comment on the issue with the link to the
live lesson AND the link to the commit map.

You can use the `create-success-comment` to create this comment

```sh
Rscript create-success-comment.R [abbrev]/[lesson]
```

For example, this is how to do it for the the lc-git release:

```sh
Rscript create-success-comment.R lc/lc-git
```

```markdown
The Workbench version is now live: https://{org}.github.io/{repo}/

In addition, here is [map of commits that were changed during the transition](https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-transition/blob/release_{tag}/release/{org}/{repo}-commit-map.hash)
```

The `{tag}` will be the `[abbrev]/[lesson]` part of the signed tag you created earlier.
