The following commits used to be merge commits but due to filtering
are now regular commits; they likely have suboptimal commit messages
(e.g. "Merge branch next into master").  Original commit hash on the
left, commit hash after filtering/rewriting on the right:
  b'5eec912fff4256121ce332cfe6c37d10cde967b6' None

The following commits were filtered out, but referenced in another
commit message.  The reference to the now-nonexistent commit hash
(or a substring thereof) was left as-is in any commit messages:
  b'079d7d50'
