The following commits used to be merge commits but due to filtering
are now regular commits; they likely have suboptimal commit messages
(e.g. "Merge branch next into master").  Original commit hash on the
left, commit hash after filtering/rewriting on the right:
  b'1148b6cffe19d049c7a9656909b184e69e12c3dc' None

The following commits were filtered out, but referenced in another
commit message.  The reference to the now-nonexistent commit hash
(or a substring thereof) was left as-is in any commit messages:
